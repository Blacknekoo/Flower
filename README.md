That's a yellow flower for 21st of september.
I know it's boyfriend's day and... I know you're not my boyfriend, but my friends and I, due to the viralisation of the yellow flower tradition, started to send yellow flowers to each other. 
(Neither of us has a boyfriend xD)
SO...So, I like you (nothing you didn't know) and I want to send you that flower. Hope you like it <3
