That's a yellow flower for 21st of september.
I know it's boyfriend's day and... I know you're not my boyfriend, but my friends and I, due to the viralisation of the yellow flower tradition, started to send pictures of yellow flowers to each other. 
(Neither of us has a boyfriend xD)
SO...So, I like you (nothing you didn't know) and I want to send you that flower. And, you told me you like to program in phyton, so i did a little effort to program it in phyton. Hope you like it <3
